### Project Setup

- plain ts + html
- package.json to keep ts and webpack versions in sync for dev
- webpack to bundle into single js file

#### Development

- started dev with node v18.14.0
- using `live-server` to hot-load the local files
- use `npm run dev` for webpack's hot reload (re-transpiles .ts -> .js)
